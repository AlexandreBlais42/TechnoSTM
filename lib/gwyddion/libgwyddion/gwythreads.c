/**

 * @short_description: Multithread processing control
 *
 * Gwyddion can utilise multithread processing via OpenMP.
 *
 * It is disabled by default.  If it is enabled, is utilised internally and
 * transparently in Gwyddion functions.  No threads are exposed in the API.
 *
 * The only exception is that when multithread processing is enabled,
 * user-supplied routines called during data processing such as #GwyNLFitFunc
 * or #GwyCooordTransform2DFunc may be called from multiple threads and must be
 * reentrant.  This does not apply to #GwySetMessageFunc and
 * #GwySetFractionFunc which are always called from the main thread.
 *
 * If you run programs or scripts based on Gwyddion in parallel, for instance
 * in a simulation or batch data processing, it is recommended to keep
 * multithread processing disabled.  For GUI programs (like Gwyddion itself) or
 * tasks run serially, it can be useful to enable it.
 *
 * If Gwyddion was not built with multithread processing support, enabling
 * threads does not do anything and gwy_threads_are_enabled() will continue to
 * return %FALSE.
 *
 * If Gwyddion is built with OpenMP-enabled FFTW, it calls fftw_init_threads()
 * when threads are enabled and can employ multithreaded FFTW.  When mixing
 * Gwyddion functions with direct FFTW utilisation, call
 * fftw_plan_with_nthreads() with your preferred number of threads before you
 * create a plan.
